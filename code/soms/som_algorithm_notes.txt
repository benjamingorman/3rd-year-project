A. Measurement of distance between input and neuron
- Euclidian (squared euclidian is common to avoid sqrt)
- Correlation
- Direction cosine
- Block distance

B. Neighbourhood functions
- Exponential decay
- h_g(w_ij, w_mn, r) = e^((-1/2)(sqrt((i-n)^2 + (j-m)^2) / r)^2)
- Cone
- Cylinder

C. Initialization of weights
- Random
- Use of random selection of input samples
- Attempt to reflect distribution of data (principal components)

D. Training
- Sequential (one input by one before weights are adjusted)
- Batch

Learning rate a(t) and neighbourhood radius r(t) decrease over time


Sometimes 2 phases are used in training process
1. Self Organizing (ordering) phase:
Topological ordering takes place for roughly 1000 iterations. Learning rate and neighbourhood radius are decreasing
2. Convergence (fine tuning) phase:
Fine tunes the map. Roughly 500 * number of neurons iterations. Small learning rate and neighbourhood radius which may be fixed.
